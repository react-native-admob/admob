If you are using `react-native >= 0.60` you just need to do a simple:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @react-native-admob/admob --save
```

## Android Setup

Add your AdMob App ID to `AndroidManifest.xml`, as described in the [Google Mobile Ads SDK documentation](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/quick-start#configure_your_app).

## iOS Setup

From the command line run (inside the ios folder):

```bash
pod install
```

Then, update your Info.plist as described in the [Google Mobile Ads SDK documentation](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/quick-start#update_your_infoplist).

### Allow iOS Static Frameworks

If you are using Static Frameworks on iOS, you need to manually enable this for the project. To enable Static Framework support, add the following global to the top of your /ios/Podfile file:

```ruby
$RNAdMobAsStaticFramework = true
```

## Requesting IDFA on iOS 14

On iOS 14 onwards, you need to request IDFA access through App Tracking Transparency Dialog to show targeted ads to the user. For that you can use [react-native-tracking-transparency](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-tracking-transparency).
